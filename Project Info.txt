GENAI PROJECT: I need to develop a gen ai project for my final year review. The below are my project info:

Project Name: Multimodal RAG-based AI Video Learning Assistant

Real Problem: Students waste hours on long videos and can’t revise easily.

Research Gap:

  Existing tools:

  > Only generate plain summaries
  > No topic segmentation
  > No Q&A with video
  > No personalization
  > No learning analytics

  My system:

  > Topic-wise understanding
  > Interactive chat
  > Personalized summaries
  > Quiz generation


Overall Project Flow:

Input YouTube URL
 → Audio extraction and checks whether it is a educational, learning or study related video 
 → Speech-to-text (Whisper)
 → Text cleaning
 → Chunking
 → Embeddings
 → Vector DB
 → LLM
 → Features:
     - Topic-wise summary
     - Chat with video
     - Quiz generator
 → Web UI
 → Cloud deployment
